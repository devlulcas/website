## üëã WHAT I DO

**I'm a software developer focused in web development.**

I do a lot of frontend work with Typescript, React JS and NextJS, and I also try to do cool things with Svelte too.

In the backend I'm usually working with pure PHP or NodeJS with Typescript. _In my free time I do some other things too. Sometimes I play with Go and Elixir_

> This is my personal website, you can see it live [here](https://lucasrego.tech). It's a work in progress, so it's not finished yet.
